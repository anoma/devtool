Some commands that could be helpful for developing or testing Anoma, but that may not make sense to include in `anomac` (currently). For example, submitting a protocol transaction signed with an arbitrary key.

Run `cargo run -- --help` (or `devtool --help` after having run `make install`) to see all possible commands.
